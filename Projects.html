    <p>
      I'm currently on a 12 week coding bootcamp, training in software
      development. Each week I have to complete different projects based on what
      I have learnt, which is based on front and back end languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the first phase of the bootcamp I have been learning about front
      end development which consists of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap
      framework. I'm learning about the DOM as well as TDD, OOP, UX and
      peripheral technologies.

              <p>
                I decided to create a football quiz because it is my favourite
                sport. And I decided to use a timer because I wanted the quiz to
                be a challenge for the user.

              <p>Project - Text Adventure Game</p>
              <p>Genre - Fantasy</p>
              <p>
                I created a fantasy style text adventure game. I decided to
                create my game as a fantasy style because I have played games
                like Oblivion, Skyrim which I enjoyed playing, so those games
                inspired me to create a game like that.

              <p>JavaScript Decoding Web App</p>
              <p>
                I wanted to create something that was simple and not
                complicated. And because the cipher was based on Ceaser's
                encryption system, I thought it would be fitting to have is
                picture in the background.

    <h3>To Be Continued...</h3>
    <p>
      For the second phase of the bootcamp I will be learning React, Redux,
      Express and Node.js and how to run the code. As well as learning about
      APIs and Databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third phase will consist of creating a final project using the 
      skills I've learnt by creating projects throughout the course.
